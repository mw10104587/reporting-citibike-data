According to past data, October is the first month that Citibike riding time starts to decline.
In 2013, the first year of operation, the total riding time reached 936116179 seconds in September, which is approximately 260032 hours. The next month, the total riding time slightly went down to 237986 hours.

October is the first month that New Yorkers start to feel the weather change.
"Averages don't really tell the story as to feel. You can get a cool last two weeks of August followed by some hot spells in September, but generally in October is when the weather starts balancing out."
said Jonathan Jaffe, who has been living in New York City for 40 years.
There had been 8.47% riding time drop in October 2013, and 14.54% in October 2014, this year

Conveniency is the main reason that keeps people riding in cold and rainy days. Mike Waring, whose business is at the west-most of Tribeca, has to commute from his home to his office in Chelsea. Neither his office or home is right next to subway station, but they are both close to Citibike stops. "I can go all the way straight down," said Waring. He will always take ride the Citibike unless it is pouring rain or strong wind. "Strong wind isn't fun," he said.

"You can start paddling away," said another Citibike fan, Andrew Battista, who was undocking his bike at the intersection of Columbus Ave. and 84th Street in the rain. Battista said he'll still be riding the bike in the winter unless there is a large pack of snow. "Everyone should be a member of Citibike," he said with a smile on his face.

Here's some Twitter post about their experience who still rode Citibike.
