1. I will be getting quotes from female riders at the Broadway Lafayette station near NYU, also talk to employers nearby to understand whether they give employee incentive to ride bikes.

2. Today I also got an contact from Department of Health & Mental Hygiene, Megan Galeucia. Their building is right next to the Citi Bike stop that has more female started rides than male. She told me that they tried to promote bikes and Citi Bike in the neighborhood, I will follow up with her to see that they've done and the results. Also get quotes regarding the data.


3. I'll visualize the fusion map of Brooklyn including the bike lane, bike stops and subway stations and see what I can find.



5. I'll do research about how other big cities' bike sharing program in Northern US tackle the winter problem



6. Call 311 for the usage of Citi Bike
4. I'll call Citi Bike and see what kind of limitations they have.


Stunt riding,

// Do you ever get contacted by the DOT or Citi Bike? I feel like it's a perfect commercia for Citi Bike.

I hate Citi Bike, the station is really ugly, the take away a lot of parking spaces, you can't walk through the street if the, they are super ugly, they take away from small businesses. from bike shops. Citi Bikes are really bad. Brooklyn Bed-stuy. It's offensive
The stations are ugly, very intrusive to the neighborhood. They're aweful.
His shop in Greenpoint is affected.

over saturated their market.

They should give up, it's way too much.

There's a YMTA and several clubs on this street, I'm here for the gym.
I like it because it usually takes me 20 minutes walking after I get out of the train, but with the bike, I arrive in two minutes.

I try to ride on the bike lane when I find one.

an Oscar backend engineer,

Well, We have a lot of incentives doing physical activities in general, we have a bike room. 
We do participate in companies biking to work plans. We also have fitenss reembracement thing. I use it for the gym, I think you can also apply to Citi Bike. 

They do that with a lot of health related thing,
company co-ed team.

It's part of our benefit. Health and welness benefit. Most people use it for the gym.
A lot of our engineers have their own bikes.

Soccer, volleyball, there might be a basketball one.
In general promoting good health
I'm one of the few smokers here, hiding.

There's a bunch of modeling agency all through this whole block.
It's also the big out door mall of Manhattah, SOHO it could be related to that.

Really close to the major train hub. Take the train here and take a bike and go around.

Moving to that area is why I had to get a bike, you just to get around the trains are more dispret
funneling you to the city or down town brooklyn. Say you wanna go from bed-stuy even to Crown Heights, you either have a long walk or you take the train into down town Brooklyn and a different train back out.

I know a lot of people will do that just to meet somewhere.

I love my area.

Maybe because the bike is blue XDDD, company mission bicycles in San Fransisco.

fundraiser, 

who has a bike at home, but you can't take bike on Metro North.

I transfer to Metro North all the way to west Chester.
If it's pouring rain, I won't ride the bike, and my alternative.

It's a lot cheaper, it's exercise, it's mental hygein, and summer time the subway smell and it's more controll.


You have to be absolutely aware.

Started the subscription Since May,

his employee was fixing the bike, while two riders sat in the store.


We're fixing bikes, we don't rent bikes.

That video went viral and you came to this shop

When I need, I rent it and it worked.
I won't say it's convenient.
